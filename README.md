# Cosmic Ray Fluence
Codes for the analysis of cosmic ray fluences.

+ To execute the code **_flux_buca_filter.ipynb_** it is necessary to have the data file **_muones_buca_1h.out.tar.gz_**
+ To execute the code **_flux_filter_machinp1.ipynb_** it is necessary to have the data file **_totalrealMachin_sample.out.tar.gz_** (The original data file has 25M of rows, this file here is a sample and has 1.5M of rows)

General description:
+ The first of the codes has the purpose of calculating the integrated and differential flux of cosmic rays, making the assumptions convenient.
The second of the codes does the same as the first one and prepares the necessary data files to be able to execute codes of propagation of muons in rock.
